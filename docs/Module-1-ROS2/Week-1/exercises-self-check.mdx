# Exercises and Self-Check Questions - Week 1: Intro to Physical AI

## Chapter 1: Foundations of Physical AI

### Conceptual Questions
1. Define Physical AI in your own words and explain how it differs from traditional digital AI.
2. What are the four core principles of Physical AI? Provide an example for each.
3. Explain the "reality gap" and why it presents a challenge for Physical AI systems.

### Application Questions
4. Identify three potential safety risks that are unique to Physical AI systems compared to digital AI systems.
5. Compare the energy efficiency requirements of a digital recommendation system versus an autonomous drone performing the same recommendation task.
6. Describe how uncertainty in sensor data affects decision-making differently in Physical AI versus digital AI systems.

### Analysis Questions
7. Analyze the failure modes of a Physical AI system versus a digital AI system. What makes Physical AI failures potentially more serious?
8. Research one existing Physical AI system and explain how its embodiment influences its intelligent behavior.

## Chapter 2: Digital vs Physical AI

### Comparison Questions
1. Create a detailed comparison chart showing the differences between digital and physical AI in terms of environmental constraints, temporal requirements, and uncertainty management.
2. Explain why real-time constraints are fundamental to Physical AI but optional for Digital AI.
3. Describe three specific examples where the same AI task would be dramatically different when implemented in digital vs. physical systems.

### Scenario-Based Questions
4. Design scenario: You want to deploy a chess-playing AI. Compare the considerations for a purely digital implementation vs. a physical robot implementation.
5. Safety scenario: Compare the safety considerations for a digital medical diagnosis AI versus a physical surgical robot implementing similar diagnostic algorithms.
6. Resource scenario: Analyze the different resource constraints that would apply to a digital image classifier versus a physical robot performing visual inspection tasks.

### Reflection Questions
7. Why might it be advantageous to start with digital AI and then extend to physical AI rather than designing physical AI from scratch?
8. What are some potential benefits of combining digital and physical AI in hybrid systems?

## Chapter 3: Embodied Intelligence Concepts

### Core Concepts
1. Explain the embodiment hypothesis in your own words and provide two examples from nature or robotics.
2. What is morphological computation? Provide three examples of how physical form can contribute to intelligent behavior.
3. Describe the sensorimotor loop and explain why it's important for embodied intelligence.

### Analysis Questions
4. Analyze how the octopus demonstrates embodied intelligence. What aspects of its intelligence emerge from its embodiment?
5. Compare two robot designs for the same task - one with specialized morphology and one with general morphology. What are the trade-offs?
6. How might the size and scale of an embodied agent affect its intelligent behaviors?

### Design Questions
7. Design an embodied agent for a specific task (e.g., cleaning, inspection, exploration). Describe how the physical form would be optimized to support the task.
8. How could you design an embodied AI system to be robust against sensor failures using principles of embodied intelligence?

## Synthesis Questions (Cross-Chapter)

1. How do the concepts of "embodiment" and "real-time constraints" from different chapters interconnect?
2. Compare the safety challenges in "Foundations" with the embodiment requirements from "Embodied Intelligence" - how does physical form help address safety challenges?
3. Design a simple Physical AI system that incorporates all three chapters' concepts: foundation principles, digital-physical differences, and embodiment.
