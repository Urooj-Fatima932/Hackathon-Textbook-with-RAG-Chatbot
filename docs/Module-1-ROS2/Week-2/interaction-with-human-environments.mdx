## Introduction to Human-Centered Robotics

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in environments originally created for humans, presenting unique challenges and opportunities. Unlike specialized robots that operate in controlled environments designed for their specific tasks, humanoid robots must navigate spaces, use tools, and interact with systems designed for human capabilities, dimensions, and social conventions.

This chapter explores the multifaceted challenges and approaches to successful interaction between robots and human environments, covering physical, social, and cognitive dimensions of this interaction.

## Physical Challenges in Human Environments
