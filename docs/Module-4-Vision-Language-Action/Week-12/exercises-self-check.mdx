# Week 12: Exercises and Self-Check

This section provides exercises and self-check questions to reinforce the concepts covered in Week 12.

## Exercises

1.  **Customize the Simulation Environment**:
    *   Add at least three new objects to the capstone simulation scene in Isaac Sim.
    *   Modify the physical properties (e.g., mass, friction) of one of the objects and observe how it affects the robot's interaction with it.

2.  **Extend the Perception Pipeline**:
    *   Choose a new sensor to add to the robot's URDF (e.g., a depth camera, a tactile sensor).
    *   Write a new ROS 2 node to process the data from this sensor and integrate it into the world model.

3.  **Train a Custom Object Detector**:
    *   Collect a small dataset of images of a new object.
    *   Fine-tune a pre-trained object detection model (e.g., YOLO, SSD) on your dataset.
    *   Integrate your custom model into the perception pipeline.

## Self-Check Questions

1.  What are the key components of the capstone simulation environment, and what is the role of each component?
2.  Explain the purpose of the ROS 2 bridge in the context of the Isaac Sim simulation.
3.  Describe the steps involved in implementing the capstone perception pipeline.
4.  What is a world model, and why is it important for an autonomous robot?
5.  How does a Vision-Language Model (VLM) contribute to the perception capabilities of the robot?

Review your answers and refer back to the chapter content if you are unsure about any of the questions. Understanding these concepts is crucial for the successful completion of the capstone project.
