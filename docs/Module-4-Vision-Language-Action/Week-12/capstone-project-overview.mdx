# Week 12: Capstone Project Overview and Goals

Welcome to the capstone project for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This project is designed to integrate all the concepts and skills you have learned over the past 11 weeks. You will build a complete system where a humanoid robot, simulated in NVIDIA Isaac Sim, can understand natural language commands, perceive its environment, and perform complex tasks in a human-centric setting.

## Project Goals

The primary goals of this capstone project are:

1.  **Integration of Acquired Knowledge**: Apply the principles of ROS 2, digital twins, sensor fusion, navigation, manipulation, and AI-driven cognitive planning in a single, cohesive project.
2.  **End-to-End System Development**: Build a full pipeline from high-level voice commands to low-level robot actions. This includes natural language processing, task planning, simulation, and control.
3.  **Human-Robot Interaction**: Implement a system that allows for natural and intuitive interaction with a humanoid robot, leveraging multi-modal inputs like speech and gestures.
4.  **Problem-Solving in a Realistic Scenario**: Tackle the challenges of developing a robotics application in a simulated environment that mimics real-world complexities.

## Project Overview

The capstone project is divided into two weeks (Week 12 and Week 13).

*   **Week 12: Setup and Perception**: You will set up the complete simulation environment for the capstone project, including the robot, the environment, and all the necessary software packages. You will also implement the perception pipeline, enabling the robot to "see" and "understand" its surroundings.
*   **Week 13: Manipulation, Navigation, and Evaluation**: You will implement the core logic for object manipulation and task execution, as well as autonomous navigation and interaction. The project will conclude with a final evaluation and a walkthrough of your completed system.

By the end of this capstone project, you will have a fully functional simulation of a humanoid robot capable of performing meaningful tasks based on human instructions. This will serve as a testament to your skills as a robotics engineer and a solid foundation for your future endeavors in the field of physical AI.
