## Notes on Image Creation
- All diagrams should follow a consistent visual style
- Use clear, readable labels and legends
- Maintain accessibility with sufficient color contrast
- Consider both light and dark mode compatibility
- Focus on illustrating complex concepts visually
- Emphasize system architecture and process flows
- Use standard robotics/IA visual conventions where applicable
