## Introduction to Error Handling in Robotics

Error handling in robotic systems represents one of the most critical aspects of system design, particularly when robots operate in unstructured environments among humans. Unlike traditional software systems where errors might result in temporary inconvenience, robotic errors can lead to physical damage, safety hazards, or even injury. The complexity is further compounded by the real-time nature of robotic systems, where delayed response to errors can escalate into critical failures.

Robotic error handling must therefore be comprehensive, addressing not just software errors but also hardware failures, perception inaccuracies, actuator malfunctions, and environmental uncertainties. The error handling system must be able to detect, identify, classify, and respond to errors in real-time while maintaining the safety of the robot, the environment, and humans in the vicinity.

Effective error handling in robotics is inherently multi-layered, incorporating preventive measures, immediate error responses, and long-term recovery strategies. It must also consider the robot's operational context, mission-critical requirements, and the potential consequences of different failure modes.
