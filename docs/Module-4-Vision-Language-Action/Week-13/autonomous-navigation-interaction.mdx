# Implementing Autonomous Navigation and Interaction

A truly autonomous robot must be able to navigate its environment safely and efficiently, and to interact with humans in a natural and intuitive way. This chapter covers the implementation of these crucial capabilities for our humanoid robot.

## Step 1: Autonomous Navigation with Nav2

We will use the ROS 2 Navigation Stack (Nav2) to enable autonomous navigation. Nav2 is a powerful and flexible framework for mobile robot navigation. You will configure Nav2 for our humanoid robot, which includes:

*   **Creating a Map**: Building a map of the environment using a SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithm.
*   **Localization**: Using a localization algorithm (e.g., AMCL) to estimate the robot's pose in the map.
*   **Path Planning**: Using a path planning algorithm (e.g., A*) to find a collision-free path to a goal.
*   **Path Following**: Using a controller to execute the planned path.

You will create a ROS 2 action client that sends a goal pose to Nav2 and monitors the progress of the navigation task.

## Step 2: Human-Robot Interaction

Effective human-robot interaction (HRI) is essential for creating robots that are not only functional but also user-friendly. In this section, you will implement several HRI modalities, including:

*   **Voice Interaction**: Using a speech recognition and synthesis engine to enable natural language communication with the robot.
*   **Gesture Recognition**: Using a computer vision model to recognize human gestures and interpret them as commands.
*   **Gaze Following**: Programming the robot to follow a person's gaze, creating a more natural and engaging interaction.

You will integrate these HRI modalities into the robot's cognitive architecture, allowing them to be used in conjunction with the task execution system. For example, a user could point to an object and say "pick that up," and the robot would be able to understand and execute the command.

## Step 3: Putting It All Together

In the final step, you will integrate the navigation and interaction systems with the object manipulation and task execution capabilities developed in the previous chapter. This will result in a complete, end-to-end system where the robot can accept high-level commands, navigate to the desired location, and perform complex manipulation tasks, all while interacting with humans in a natural and intuitive manner.

This chapter marks the culmination of your journey in this course. By completing it, you will have built a truly impressive and capable humanoid robot system.
