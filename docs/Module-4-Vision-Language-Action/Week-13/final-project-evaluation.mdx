# Final Project Evaluation and Walkthrough

Congratulations on reaching the final chapter of the capstone project! This chapter is dedicated to evaluating the performance of your completed system and providing a comprehensive walkthrough of its capabilities.

## Evaluation Criteria

The performance of your humanoid robot system will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1.  **Task Success Rate**: The ability of the robot to successfully complete a variety of tasks, from simple navigation goals to complex manipulation commands.
2.  **Robustness**: The ability of the robot to handle unexpected situations and recover from errors.
3.  **Efficiency**: The speed and smoothness of the robot's movements and task execution.
4.  **Human-Robot Interaction Quality**: The naturalness and intuitiveness of the interaction with the robot.

## Evaluation Scenarios

You will test your system in a series of evaluation scenarios, each designed to assess a different aspect of its performance. These scenarios will include:

*   **Scenario 1: Basic Navigation**: Command the robot to navigate to different locations in the environment.
*   **Scenario 2: Object Manipulation**: Command the robot to pick up and place various objects.
*   **Scenario 3: Task Planning**: Give the robot a high-level command that requires it to decompose the task into multiple sub-tasks.
*   **Scenario 4: Human-Robot Interaction**: Interact with the robot using voice and gesture commands.

For each scenario, you will record the robot's performance and document any successes or failures.

## Project Walkthrough

The final part of this chapter is a project walkthrough, where you will provide a detailed demonstration of your completed system. This walkthrough should include:

*   A brief overview of the system architecture.
*   A demonstration of each of the evaluation scenarios.
*   A discussion of the key challenges you faced during the project and how you overcame them.
*   A reflection on what you have learned and how you might improve the system in the future.

This walkthrough will serve as the final deliverable for the capstone project and a showcase of your skills as a robotics engineer.

Thank you for your hard work and dedication throughout this course. We hope you are proud of what you have accomplished and that you will continue to explore the exciting field of physical AI and humanoid robotics.
