# Implementing Object Manipulation and Task Execution

With the perception pipeline in place, the robot can now "see" and "understand" its environment. This chapter focuses on the next logical step: enabling the robot to interact with its surroundings through object manipulation and task execution.

## From Perception to Action

The bridge between perception and action is a cognitive architecture that can reason about the state of the world and generate a sequence of actions to achieve a given goal. This architecture will take the world model from the perception pipeline as input and output a series of commands for the robot's controllers.

## Step 1: Grasping and Manipulation

Grasping is a fundamental skill for any manipulative robot. You will implement a grasping pipeline that includes:

*   **Grasp Pose Generation**: Identifying stable grasp poses for a given object.
*   **Motion Planning**: Planning a collision-free path for the robot's arm to reach the grasp pose.
*   **Gripper Control**: Actuating the robot's gripper to securely grasp the object.

We will use a pre-trained grasp generation model to simplify this process. You will create a ROS 2 action server that takes an object ID as input and executes the entire grasping pipeline.

## Step 2: High-Level Task Execution

The ultimate goal is to enable the robot to perform complex tasks based on natural language commands. This requires a high-level task planner that can decompose a complex goal into a sequence of simpler sub-tasks.

For example, the command "pick up the red block and place it on the blue block" would be decomposed into the following sub-tasks:

1.  Navigate to the red block.
2.  Grasp the red block.
3.  Navigate to the blue block.
4.  Place the red block on the blue block.

You will implement a task execution engine that can manage the state of the task, execute sub-tasks in the correct order, and handle any errors that may occur.

## Step 3: Integration with the LLM Planner

The high-level task planner will be driven by a Large Language Model (LLM). You will create a ROS 2 service that sends a natural language command to the LLM and receives a structured task plan in return. This plan will then be passed to the task execution engine for execution.

By the end of this chapter, your humanoid robot will be able to perform a variety of object manipulation tasks based on high-level commands, demonstrating a significant step towards true autonomy.
