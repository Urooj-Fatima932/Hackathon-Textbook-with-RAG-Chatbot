# Week 13: Exercises and Self-Check

This section provides exercises and self-check questions to reinforce the concepts covered in Week 13.

## Exercises

1.  **Implement a New Manipulation Task**:
    *   Choose a new manipulation task for the robot to perform (e.g., opening a door, pushing a button).
    *   Implement the necessary logic to enable the robot to complete this task.

2.  **Improve the Navigation Performance**:
    *   Experiment with different Nav2 parameters to improve the robot's navigation performance (e.g., speed, accuracy).
    *   Implement a new recovery behavior to help the robot get unstuck if it encounters a difficult situation.

3.  **Add a New HRI Modality**:
    *   Choose a new HRI modality to add to the system (e.g., facial expression recognition, emotion detection).
    *   Integrate this new modality into the robot's cognitive architecture.

## Self-Check Questions

1.  Describe the steps involved in implementing a grasping pipeline for a humanoid robot.
2.  What is a high-level task planner, and why is it important for an autonomous robot?
3.  Explain the role of Nav2 in the capstone project.
4.  What are some of the key challenges in human-robot interaction, and how did you address them in your project?
5.  Reflect on the performance of your completed system. What are its strengths and weaknesses, and how could you improve it in the future?

Review your answers and refer back to the chapter content if you are unsure about any of the questions. A thorough understanding of these concepts will be invaluable as you continue your journey in the field of robotics.
