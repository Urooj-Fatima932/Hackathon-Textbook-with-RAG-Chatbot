## Introduction to Multi-Modal Sensing

Multi-modal sensing combines information from different types of sensors to create a comprehensive understanding of the environment. In robotics, this typically involves integrating data from cameras, LiDAR, IMUs, GPS, and other specialized sensors. Each sensor modality provides unique information with different strengths and limitations, making their integration essential for robust robotic perception.

Effective multi-modal integration enables robots to operate reliably in complex environments where no single sensor can provide complete information. The challenge lies in combining these diverse data sources into coherent and actionable information for robot control and decision-making systems.

## Synchronization Challenges

### Temporal Alignment

Multi-modal sensors often operate at different frequencies and may have varying latencies:
- Cameras typically operate at 30-60 Hz

### Latency Management

Different sensors have varying processing latencies:
- Camera processing may take 10-100ms
- LiDAR processing typically takes 5-50ms
- IMU data is available nearly instantaneously
- GPS data may have 100-500ms latency

Effective systems must account for these latency differences to ensure accurate temporal alignment of sensor data.
